        <h1>How Apexlinks works</h1>

        <p>
            Apexlinks works by matching tags in your searches 
            with tags in user profiles and item's tags.
            Approximate matching is used, which means mispellings
            and partially matching tags are also matched, arranged
            in descending order from the closest match.
